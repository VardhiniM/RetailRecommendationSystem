# RetailRecommendationSystem
Perform market basket analysis and create association rules to recommend items that are commonly bought together

Analyze the transactional data for the retail store to provide insights on the items that are bought together frequently. This will help the retail store to plan its design and layout of the products to improve profits.

I have used Apriori algorithm to calculate the association mining rules based on this package (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/association_rules/#example-1-generating-association-rules-from-frequent-itemsets)
